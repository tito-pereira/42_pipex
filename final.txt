Hello there, this it the input file.
This file was created to test the pipex.
Nothing fancy, let's just use simple commands to simplify the testing.

To test it, let's do the following commands:
- execute pipex with "./pipex";
- use this file as the first argument "input_file.txt";
- use a simple command like "cat" as the first command;
- use another simple command like "wc -l" as the pipe command;
- use "output_file.txt" as the output location for the pipe;

The final command will look like:

$ ./pipex input_file.txt cat "wc -l" output_file.txt

To see if it works, just use:

$ cat output_file.txt

If the number 20 is displayed, the pipex program works.
