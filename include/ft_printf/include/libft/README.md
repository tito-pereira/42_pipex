This is 42's first Common Core project after 42's intensive Piscine of C basics.
In this project, i was tasked with creating my very first personal library of support
functions that i would be allowed to use in my subsequent projects in 42,
and then compile it into a static library using a Makefile.
Like every single other 42 project, it had several goals in mind:
- practice of basic C syntax, logic, data types and structures;
- dynamic memory allocation management;
- use of tools like GDB and Valgrind to debug, avoid memory leaks and errors;
- incomplete instructions to promote self learning and error solving;
- familiarity with Makefile and compilers;
- introduction to structures and linked lists;
- etc;

This project was made while studying in 42 Porto as part of the Computer Science
Common Core curriculum.
It was made according to 42's Norm for good code etiquette, which includes rules regarding:
- correct indentation;
- maximum line lenght of 81 characters;
- maximum function size of 25 lines;
- maximum 5 functions per file;
- mandatory 42 signature file header;
- forbidden use of "for", "do / while", "switch / case", "goto";
- and many others...
