This project was part of 42's Computer Science Common Core, where i continued
to solidify my basics of C programming. In this project, i was tasked with creating
a library which included my previously made libft library and a new function called
"get_next_line" which made use of a static variable to continuously retrieve the next
line from a certain file descriptor passed as argument.
Like every single other 42 project, it had several goals in mind:
- continued practice of basic C syntax, logic, data types and structures;
- dynamic memory allocation management;
- use of tools like GDB and Valgrind to debug, avoid memory leaks and errors;
- incomplete instructions to promote self learning and error solving;
- familiarity with Makefile and compilers;
- use of static variables;
- use of file descriptors;
- use of input/output functions;
- etc;

This project was made while studying in 42 Porto as part of the Computer Science
Common Core curriculum.
It was made according to 42's Norm for good code etiquette, which includes rules regarding:
- correct indentation;
- maximum line lenght of 81 characters;
- maximum function size of 25 lines;
- maximum 5 functions per file;
- mandatory 42 signature file header;
- forbidden use of "for", "do / while", "switch / case", "goto";
- and many others...
